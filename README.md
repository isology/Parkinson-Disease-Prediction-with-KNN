# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction-with-KNN
A Machine Learning model using K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to Predict Parkinson Disease 

To Run The Code:

**1) INSTALLATION OF CODE ENVIRONMENT**
Project Jupyterâ€™s tools are available for installation via the Python Package Index, the leading repository of software created for the Python programming language.

This text file uses instructions with pip, the recommended installation tool for Python. If you require environment management as opposed to just installation, look into conda, mamba, pipenv, and Homebrew.

**You can either choose between JupyterLab or JupyterNotebook**
JupyterLab
Install JupyterLab with pip:

pip install jupyterlab
Note: If you install JupyterLab with conda or mamba, we recommend using the conda-forge channel.

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

jupyter lab

Jupyter Notebook
Install the classic Jupyter Notebook with:

pip install notebook
To run the notebook:

jupyter notebook

**IF you have homebrew: **
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS and Linux. You can use it to install Jupyter by running:

brew install jupyterlab

**2) TO RUN THE MODEL**
You have to unzip the **parkinson_disease_dataset.zip**

After that copy the path file of the extracted file then change the:
data = pd.read_csv("your_path_here.csv")

Then run cells one by one.
